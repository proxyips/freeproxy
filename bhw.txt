For the people who want to control their own proxy, this thread is for you.

TLDR; You will need a Debian 9 clean install from any cloud provider also must run as root user:
Step 1
[code]
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/proxyips/freeproxy/main/freeproxy.sh 
[/code]

Step 2
Get your public IP address from your server
[code]
curl https://ifconfig.me
[/code]

Or
Select your public IP address
[code]
ip a
[/code]

Step 3
Get the public IP address from the device. You are going to use it to connect to your proxy.
If you are using your computer or a device on your home/office network. Just open up a browser and go to.
[code]
https://ifconfig.me
[/code]

Step 4
You must now edit freeproxy.sh file. Change the 1.1.1.1 with the IP address from Step 2.  Then change 2.2.2.2 with the ip address you got from Step 3. Also, you need to replace change_user with your username and change change_password with your password. Then save the changes.
[code]
nano freeproxy.sh
chmod +x freeproxy.sh
./freeproxy.sh
[/code]

Step 5 
Using the proxy.  Now that you have a nice new and shiny dual proxy server.  One port connects you to the tor network and the other port connects you to public proxies.  I will update the list often and place them in this thread. Remember to change 1.1.1.1 to the address you get in Step 2.
Tor connection
[code]
curl -x 1.1.1.1:8090 https://ifconfig.me
[/code]
Public proxies
[code]
curl -x 1.1.1.1:8091 https://ifconfig.me
[/code]

Any question post them.  I will reply and help with any questions related to this script.
